        \n1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast
        \n3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour
        \n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)
        \n2 teaspoons kosher salt
        \n1 teaspoon sugar</string>
    <string name="pizzaDesc">Add one and half cup of water
        \nPreheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet): Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475째F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour.
        \nDivide the dough into 2 balls: Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.
        \nPrep the toppings: Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.
        \nFlatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round: Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface.
        \nBrush the dough top with olive oil: Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling.
        \nSprinkle the pizza peel with cornmeal, put flattened dough on top: Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with cornmeal.
        \nBake: Bake pizza in the 475째F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes.
